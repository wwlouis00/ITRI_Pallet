# Project and Scope of Work
The following tasks need to be completed for this project:
Review of literature on algorithms for identifying the appearance and quantity of goods.
Design and development of AI models for identifying the appearance and quantity of goods.
### Writing identification models in Python.
- Definition of image input.- Input of two images, removal of unnecessary background, comparison of the differences between
the two images, generation of similarity values, and issuance of alerts on differences in a stack of
boxes.
- Input of a group of images of boxes on a pallet, approximately two diagonal images and one from
the top, estimation of the length, width, and height of the boxes on the pallet based on pallet size
information, and calculation of the quantity of boxes on the pallet.
### Design and explanation of model processes.
- Explanation of model architecture and processes.
- Explanation of model testing.
- API design.
 ### Summary report.
## Work Schedule
Effective from the commissioning date until October 30, 113.
During the work period, the commissioned party must regularly or irregularly conduct work progress
discussions according to the needs of the commissioning party.
## Acceptance Items
- Before the end of the period, provide the following documents for acceptance in stages:
- A planning report on the architecture, database structure, input parameters, and output data of the
- AI recognition model for the appearance and quantity of goods stacked on pallets.
- Submission of an executable model file that can operate in the commissioning party's environment,
and delivery of the original files of the AI recognition model and related execution system programs,
APIs in electronic format.
- Additionally, provide an electronic document containing instructions for using the AI recognition
model, parameter settings files, etc
